How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Easier job because no need to go through all lines of code, just those that are different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

No need to manually make several copies of a file history. If I make a change to program code and later notice that 
it's a bad change, it's easy to get back to how the code was before.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: possibly not working versions saved
Cons: possible that I do not commit often enough

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Files are possibly connected so it makes sense to save them at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log gives the complete history. Git diff gives the diference beetween two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always return to the code that surely works

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
