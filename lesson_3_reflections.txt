When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I work from several computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want that the code actually works and is not incomplete.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone made by Github. I can use it if I want to change someone elses code.
Clone is kind of downloading code from Github to my computer or in my computer from place to place.
Branch means I make for example two altenative versions of same code.
